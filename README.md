# Towers of Hanoi Puzzle

## Description

The tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle.
The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size,
the smallest at the top, thus approximating a canonical shape.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the stack to another tower following these simple rules:
* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty tower.
* No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
